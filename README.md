## Features

**Flavortown GitHub Exporter** is a browser extension that streamlines the process of sharing your GitHub projects on [Flavortown](https://flavortown.hackclub.com/). Instead of manually copying and pasting information from your repositories, this extension does all the heavy lifting for you.

### Core Features

- **One-Click Import** - Adds an "Import from GitHub" button directly to the Flavortown new project page
- **Browse Your Repos** - Displays all your public GitHub repositories in an elegant modal interface
- **Auto-Fill Forms** - Automatically fills in project details including:
  - Project name
  - Repository URL
  - Demo/homepage link
  - README link
- **Language Detection** - Shows programming languages with color badges
- **Star Count Display** - See your repo's stars at a glance
- **Secure** - Your GitHub token is stored locally in your browser and never sent to third parties
- **Fast & Lightweight** - Minimal performance impact, only active on Flavortown pages

### AI Features (v2.0+)

- **AI Description Generation** - Auto-generate project descriptions using AI, directly from the import modal
- **AI Declaration Generation** - Generate an honest AI usage declaration for your Flavortown submission with one click
- **AI Contribution Detector** - Automatically detects AI-generated code in a repository (Copilot commits, co-authored-by markers, etc.) and prompts you to fill in the AI Declaration field
- **Multiple AI Providers** - Choose the AI that works best for you:
  - **GitHub Copilot** — uses your existing Copilot subscription, no extra API key needed
  - **Ollama** — run AI fully locally, no API key required
  - **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** — requires an OpenAI API key
  - **Claude (Anthropic)** — requires an Anthropic API key
  - **OpenRouter** — access many models via a single API key, with free-model filter
- **Dynamic Model Loading** — model lists are fetched live for each provider
- **Free-Only Filter** — toggle to show only free models (OpenRouter)
- **Connection Test** — verify your AI settings before generating
- **Manual Repo Input** — paste an `owner/repo` string to trigger AI detection without browsing your repos
